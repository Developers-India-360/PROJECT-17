      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>Python is one of the most commonly used programming languages today and is easy for beginners to learn because of its readability. It is a free, open-source programming language with extensive support modules and community development, easy integration with web services, user-friendly data structures, and GUI-based desktop applications. It is a popular programming language for machine learning and deep learning applications.

Best Programming Languages to Learn in 2021
Once, only a few people were considered computer programmers with cutting-edge coding skills. Now, many IT jobs require a solid grasp of the top programming languages — yes, more than one.</p>

      <h2> C and C++</h2>
      <p>C is probably the oldest commonly used programming language and is the root of other programming languages such as C#, Java, and JavaScript. C++ is an enhanced version of C. Many developers today skip learning C on its own, while others think learning C first provides a valuable foundation for C++ development. Both languages are widely used in computer science and programming.

      <h2>Javascript</h2>
      <p>
        Javascript is a scripting language, often used to make web pages interactive. It’s text-based, written in an HTML document and run through a web browser.

There are plenty of jobs out there for JavaScript developers. Anyone looking for a job as a front end web developer (the person who does the coding for the part of the website you actually see, as opposed to the database or servers) will also need to know Javascript, in addition to HTML, CSS and other scripting languages.

      <h2>SQL</h2>
      <p>
        Pronounced “sequel,” SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a special-purpose programming language used for getting information from and updating databases. Since nearly all businesses run a database system of some kind, SQL is a good skill to have on your resume. It’s also one of the easier tech skills to learn, with numerous tutorials and free resources online (we like this one that lets you learn the language while blowing up spaceships).
